name:                BLAS360
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            A native haskell implementation of the BLAS library
description:         BLAS is a is a FORTRAN 77 library developed by the NSF
    and DOE to provide highly precise and efficient implementations of basic
    linear algebra operations.

    There have been several attempts to interface Haskell with BLAS (hblas,
    blas, blas-hs, HBlas, hmatrix to name a few), but they all suffer from the
    same limitation - they attempt to call an existing C library from Haskell.
    The user of those implementations are faced with a Cornelian dilemma:
    perform computations in Haskell using possibly unsafe operations on pointers
    to C data structures,  or to incur a potentially enormous cost in marshaling
    Haskell data structures each time a BLAS call is invoked.

    This library takes a different approach.   Rather than attempt to access an
    existing BLAS library in C, we provide native Haskell implementations of
    the basic linear algebra subroutines.     To ensure our code is pure and
    thread safe, our functions may have slightly different type signatures than
    their FORTRAN counterparts.
